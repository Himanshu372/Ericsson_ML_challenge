# Ericsson_ML_challenge
Involves code for two challenges

1.Data have been extracted from a website that provides job reviews. The website wants to analyze texts and the corresponding rating that is provided by the user about startups. A research team wants to analyze the liability of the review. In other words, they want to verify whether texts correspond as the same as the score that is provided as the rating for a startup.  This task helps the website to rank the user's reviews or ratings.




2.We are living in a digital world where people prefer to read articles online or watch videos rather than reading a book. Assume that you are a member of a marketing agency and you are given a dataset having the title, subjects, and other features based on which you have to predict what will be the material of to-be-published research so that you can tie-up with an ideal publisher and help them grow. The following are the material types:
Book
Sound disc
Videocassette
Sound cassette
Music
Mixed
CR
Task is to predict any of the classes for the test data.
